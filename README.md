This program has been tested and compiled on VSCode using G++ compiler within the IDE itself. Testing of this code in other IDEs with other forms of compilers has not been done and is not guaranteed to work. The main flow of the application is compiled on main.cpp, compiling on other cpp files may not work or produce the results as expected.
